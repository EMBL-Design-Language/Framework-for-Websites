# Framework for Webistes

##### Part of the EMBL Design Language

For the near/mid future this will only be a limited to a very rough schematic.

## What this isn't

This isn't a full-featured framework to build an EMBL branded website.

## What this is

- Barebones: This is a barebones implementation schematic representation of one possible format for EMBL sites.
- Discovery: This tooling will help us discover spacing and navigation structures for EMBL sites.
- A resource: Use this in your html mockups by including the css `link to css file here`
- For websites: Use this tooling for to build all manner of websites that are primarily EMBL affiliated (EMBL homepage, trainging, people directories, research teams, services, etc.)
