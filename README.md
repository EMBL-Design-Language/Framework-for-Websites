# framework
The EMBL Design Language framework. This is limited to a very rough schematic for the near/mid future.

## What this isn't
This isn't a full-featured framework to build an EMBL branded website.

## What this is
- Barebones: This is a barebones implementation schematic representation of one possible format for EMBL sites.
- Discovery: This tooling will help us discover spacing and navigation structures for EMBL sites.
- A resource: Use this in your html mockups by including the css `link to css file here`
